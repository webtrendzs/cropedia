Alice is an Agricultural extension worker based in Limuru. As part of her work, she usually holds training session with farmers on different crops. She has a big folder with a library of crop training information that has name of crop, altitude, farming method, time to harvest. Each crop has a number of diseases that a farmer needs to check on.

Alice is not really familiar with web-based applications and hence needs an easy to use interface. 

Alice wants a simple system to digitally manage the above library i..e. enter and view crop training information. 

You are tasked with creating the first prototype of the above system in 2 hours.  The system should be in line with MVC (Model – View – Controller) standards. Feel free to use any PHP framework.

#### Framework ####

This is a simple solution based on Code Igniter framework

#### Database structure ####

Please find the database structure in assets/sql
